# In this project, I was expected to develop a Shazam-like app to recognize and classify different kinds of music. The training data is mostly from time and spectral signal analysis. After that, the backpropagation (BP) network was implemented to classify these data. An accuracy of 85% in classification by music timbre was achieved upon tuning the network parameters.

How to implement?

The main.m is used for music feature extraction, it generates dataforBP.mat. main.m need to be run when implement the function the first time.

mainBPclass.m is the main function

How to use:
 (1) Open MATLAB.
 (2) Open mainBPclass.m on the interface.
 (3) After opening, click the green "Run" button at top or press F5 to run the program.
 (4) After clicking "Run", a dialog will show up, click the first choice "Change Folder", then the program will run and get the result.
